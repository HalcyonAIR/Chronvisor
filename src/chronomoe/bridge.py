"""
Bridge between MoE routing and Chronovisor dynamics.

Translates:
- MoE routing stats -> Chronovisor observables (alignment signals)
- Chronovisor state -> pressure biases for router

Core principle: MoE router still makes the decision, but Chronovisor
gently tilts the logits in favor of globally trusted experts.
Pressure is a wind, not a hand.
